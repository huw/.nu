#My personal website
An exercise in simplicity, while maintaining accessibility

##How to build
Install nodejs, clone the repo and type in a terminal:
`sudo npm install`
then
`sudo node app`
(Remove the sudo if you're on windows)

One of the benefits of this is that it's modular to host whichever of my projects are in the folder it's loaded to. As of writing it's running Spacerave2014 on top of the main page, but could really run anything HTML.
