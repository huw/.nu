#My personal website
I figured I would need a useful webpage to show off myself and my programming experience to the web. It is set up with multiple sections for different purposes, which provide an introduction, then contact methods, and finally a portfolio.

##How to build
Install nodejs, clone the repo and type in a terminal:
'''sudo npm install -g express'''
then 
'''sudo npm install'''
(Remove the sudo if you're on windows)

After that, copy the file settings.json.eg to settings.json, and put your API key for the Google Maps Javascript API v3 (or above) between the quotes. Normal JSON.

##Splash page
The splash page includes anchor links which smooth scroll down to the sections of the page. Also there is the infinitely rotating gear, more of an aesthetic filler than anything else.

##Me
This section tells the user some quick facts about me in a simple form. The background is based on my Cover Photo, and my profile picture is pulled from Gravatar. We also give the nice fact of seconds until I turn whatever my next age is, and then the amount of BitBucket commits I have made. Finally we show my reddit karma, more of a fun thing than making a statement.

##Chat
The chat section gives a Google Maps widget to Sydney, showing people where I can be physically reached. Then we have links to each site I have a presence on and the URL/handle. This is important as it allows a user taking a glance to the page to know where to go and to show a trend between my handles.

##Creations
Here I show people my creations and some quick data on the story of it. It provides options to be linked, or to get a preview of the website.

##Footer
Almost like a conclusion, I reiterate the links to my sections, and round it off with a nice quote from Douglas Adams which effectively sums up my page.
