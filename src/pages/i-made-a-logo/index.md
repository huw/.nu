Cam W sent me a message a few weeks ago asking if I could put together a logo for the Sydney University Astronomy Society. Cam's into space. [I made a book for him a couple years ago](/joke-of-the-day).

I picked up design over time by just doing a lot of random things whenever I could. Everyone needs better design, and when they wanted it, I'd put my hand up and exercise my skills. I didn't know before this that I could actually design a real logo, but apparently now I can. Maybe an insight into my process can help you ðŸ™‚.
