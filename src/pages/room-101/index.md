excerpt: I wrote a TV sitcom screenplay in my last year of high school. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.

Like most other countries, Australian high school students sit a set of exams called the Higher School Certificate â€” except some of them, like English Extension 2, aren't exams at all.

Instead, we spent the year researching and handcrafting a body of work, learning and understanding the writing, drafting, and re-drafting process as we went. While the deadlines were tight and the criticism was harsh, it was one of the most rewarding experiences I had at high school. I wish all students had an opportunity like this.

It's called [__Room 101__](./room-101.pdf), and it's about a high school English department. Any and all resemblance to real English teachers I know is purely coincidental.
